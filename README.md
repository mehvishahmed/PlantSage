# PlantSage: Your Botanical Guru

PlantSage is an innovative project that leverages the power of machine learning to assist individuals in identifying and understanding medicinal plants. Whether you're an amateur botanist, a healthcare practitioner, or simply a nature enthusiast, PlantSage provides an accessible and user-friendly platform to recognize various plant species used for their healing properties.

# Project Overview

Medicinal plants have played a crucial role in traditional medicine and natural remedies for centuries. However, the lack of easily accessible and reliable information about these plants poses a significant challenge. PlantSage aims to bridge this knowledge gap by combining advanced technology with deep botanical expertise.

# Key Features

Image Classification: PlantSage employs state-of-the-art machine learning models to classify plant species from images. The project includes the following models:

1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): This deep learning model excels at image recognition tasks. It utilizes convolutional layers to detect features in plant images and provides highly accurate classifications.
2. Random Forest: A versatile ensemble learning method, Random Forest offers robust classification capabilities.
3. SVM (Support Vector Machine): SVM is a powerful model for both classification and regression tasks.
4. KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors): KNN relies on similarity metrics to classify plant images based on their closeness to training data points.
5. MLP (Multilayer Perceptron): A neural network model with hidden layers for intricate feature extraction and classification.
   
Comprehensive Knowledge: PlantSage isn't just an image recognition tool; it also provides detailed information about each plant species. Users can access information about a plant's characteristics, traditional uses, and potential health benefits.

Traditional Knowledge Preservation: The project emphasizes preserving traditional knowledge about medicinal plants, ensuring that valuable insights from indigenous and local communities are not forgotten.

# How to Use

PlantSage's user-friendly interface makes it easy for anyone to get started. Simply upload a photo of a plant leaf, and let the machine learning models work their magic. The system will not only identify the plant species but also provide you with valuable information about it.
